									<div class="timeline-body">
										<p>We “supposedly” met by chance at a midnight movie in college. Stephen was there with some friends, one of which I had a few classes with. I ran up to greet her and meet her new husband and I was so excited to see her that I never even noticed her other friends, including Stephen. Later we sat a few rows in front of them at the movies. Right before the movie was starting I heard someone yell “Hey Janet, have you met Stephen?” I turned around to see who was calling but didn’t see anyone in the dark theater so I yelled back “Ah, hi?” </p>
									<br />
										<p>Stephen asked his friend about me in the meantime and she told him that I was great and “wasn’t crazy at all” (boy was she wrong). So the next day Stephen messaged me on Facebook, explaining that he had met me at the movies and he thought I was cute! <i><b>It took me nearly 4 hours to compose that message and her response - Here’s my number I don’t like Facebook chat.  I guess it worked.</b></i>  We began talking a little and about a week later went on our first date.</p>

										<p>Stephen was very nervous for our first date
											<i><b>(yeah and Janet was the picture of calm...)</b></i>.
											So nervous in fact that he forget to look up directions on how to get to the restaurant.
											Stephen’s phone didn’t connect to GPS properly, and it being 2013 I naturally still had a flip phone. Neither of us able to look up directions, we drove around for about 45 minutes, in and out of different parking lots, until eventually we spotted the <i>Outback Steakhouse</i>.
											<i><b>At this point she is claiming that she loves getting lost and I haven’t ruined the date at all. I figured she thought I was an idiot.</b></i>
											We sat in the restaurant for a few hours talking and then he even treated me to some froyo after! Going on hour 5 of the date, we were having such a good time that I convinced Stephen to watch Pride and Prejudice  (My favorite movie) for the first… and last time (so far).
											By the time he dropped me off at my dorm our date had lasted 7 hours and we both had the best day! </p>

										<h3 class="timeline-title">First Camping Adventure</h3>
										<span class="date">June 2014</span>
									</div>
									<div class="timeline-body">
										<p>About a year into our relationship I convinced (<i><b>it didn’t take much</b></i>) Stephen to try camping... my way! It was suggested I take it easy on him, start simple, so that I don’t scare him out of roughing it. So naturally I planned a <i><b>(complicated)</b></i> trip to Turtle Flambeau. Turtle Flambeau is a flowage with many little islands to camp on <i><b>(How cool is that! Obviously I had no idea what I was getting myself into!)</b></i>, but you have to canoe out to get to the islands.  I started telling Stephen all about this trip and he was on board!</p>
										<br />
										<p>We drove out to Wisconsin and stopped at a campsite just outside of Turtle Flambeau. Our plan was to stay two days, to get Stephen acclimated to camping and canoeing (my dad’s suggestion). Boy I am glad we did because as it turned out, Stephen had never been canoeing before. We got into the canoe, I was in back steering and Stephen was in front.  Stephen was paddling so hard that it was all I could do to keep from going in circles. <i><b>I remember my instructions were to “paddle hard” so I “paddled hard”.</b></i>  Eventually a little teamwork won out and we got the hang of it. The day we canoed out to our island, we spent 5 hours bouncing from island to island looking at each campsite until we found the perfect one. We spent a week there! Stephen learned how to pump water <i><b>(I only fell in once)</b></i> and start fires in the rain <i><b>(that didn’t go too well)</b></i>. He chopped wood during the day and in the evening quietly listen to the wolf howling 10ft from our tent. It was a wonderful week. The day we had to pack up and leave, a storm rolled in about 5 minutes into us canoeing out. While it took us hours to get to the campsite, it took us an hour <i><b>(if that)</b></i> to make it back to the car. We had the best time!</p>

									<div class="timeline-body">
										<p>My senior year of college I moved into the best little house with a few girlfriends. One of my roommates was puppy sitting one day, and I fell in love. Stephen and I had been talking about getting a puppy for a long time, and playing with this little pup was the straw the broke the camel's back. A friend had mentioned to me earlier that year that Australian Shepherds were hypoallergenic, and with my dog allergies I decided an Aussie would be best for us. <i><b>Of course neither of us actually looked into that.</b></i> We started looking for Aussies everywhere, contacting breeders, looking at local kennels, until I stumbled upon a little puppy named Violet. I had already decided she was my girl before I even showed the picture to Stephen, he had no choice in the matter. <i><b>She had already agreed to a price and set the meeting with the breeder for the NEXT DAY before she showed me the picture!</b></i> It wasn’t until after I had set everything up that we finally decided to verify that Aussies really are hypoallergenic… They aren’t; Not at all. But I was so in love with the puppy already that there was no stopping me. The next morning we woke up at 5:00 am, and drove 2 hours to get the puppy, then drove 2 hours back so I could make it to work on time. </p>
										<br />
										<p>I made rules to post around the house, things like “The puppy will be brushed every day.” and “The puppy will not be allowed on the furniture, ever!.” and my favorite “I will vacuum every day” I don’t think we had Penny <i><b>(we changed her name to Penelope Annabell or Penny for short when we got her.)</b></i> for a full week before I had broken every rule on my list Luckily I never developed allergies to her and Penny is one of the best decisions we have ever made!</p>

									<div class="timeline-body">
										<p>Stephen had successfully made it camping a few times at this point in our relationship, so naturally it was time to take him backpacking. <i><b>I was all for another adventure!</b></i> We decided to go to the Appalachian Mountains, and I picked out a few easier trails that I thought would be a good starting place for backpacking. Stephen told me that they all seemed boring, so I told him to pick the trail (Only a little exasperated). <i><b>I figured we were good at hiking in Missouri, so how hard could a “Hard” trail in the mountains actually be?</b></i> </p>
										<br />
										<p>We began packing our backpacks for the trip and they just kept getting heavier, and heavier, and heavier and we didn’t worry too much about it. Stephen and I began researching the trail, printing out maps, reading trail directions, etc. But in all this planning we never thought to make sure Stephen had his hiking boots. Then the night before the trip was when we realized that his boots were nowhere to be found. So we went out about bought him a brand new pair of hiking boots. <i><b>Worst possible solution.</b></i> And the next day we began our trek east. </p>
										<br />
										<p>The first day on the trail we knew already how dumb we were <i><b>(I was)</b></i>, the trail began with a 3,000ft climb in the first day, our packs were WAY TOO HEAVY, and Stephen’s shoes were rubbing wrong on his feet already.</p>
										<br />
										<p>What follows was 3 days of broken water pumps, altitude sickness, bleeding feet <i><b>(NEVER buy new shoes right before a hike!)</b></i> and hitchhiking home. But what blew all of that away was the most incredible views and amazing experience we had. It was exhausting but exhilarating. <i><b>We found out three miles from the end of the hike that the locals call it The Death March!</b></i>  We survived even managing to have an incredible time <i><b>(Janet even saved me from dehydration and altitude sickness)</b></i> and cannot wait to go back and do it right the next time!</p>

										<p>About 2 years ago Stephen and I decided we wanted to move to Kansas City! I began looking for jobs in the area and was lucky enough to get my current job in Leavenworth KS, teaching elementary music!</p>
										<br />
										<p>We had been talking about buying a home for a long time, and it seemed like the right time. We looked at 16 different houses, before finding the perfect one! It was a 7 hour drive each time we wanted to see a house, but thanks to some amazing friends we didn’t have to make the drive for every house. When our home came on the market we were in the car and driving within 3 hours. Not even 6 hours after it went on the market, we were told it had already sold, but since we were already halfway to KC we decided to come and sit on our hands and wait for the next perfect home. So we waited, and watched, and drove by, and held our breaths, and the buyers fell through. We snatched up the house as soon as we could, and have loved living here ever since. </p>
										<br />
										<p>We built a beautiful raised bed garden that has become my pride and joy and planted some apple trees that we are still learning to care for properly. We have sixteen different fruits and vegetables now and I spend all my free time in the garden. <i><b>Meanwhile I have been clearing the overgrown back yard and building furniture in the garage workshop.</b></i> Our house has been everything we could have asked for and more.</p>

										<p>I have always loved swings! Park swings, porch swings, and most important, tree swings. I have been hinting for as long as I have known Stephen that I wanted a tree swing! <i><b>She says hinted like it was subtle.</b></i> Well Stephen finally decided to give me just that! He banned me from the garage and spent a month hiding out there, making me something.</p>
										<br />
										<p>That morning I went to yoga class, and he hung my swing! When I got home, he tried waiting until I noticed the swing hanging on a tree in our backyard, but I never did. Finally, once he pointed it out <i><b>(I said something along the lines of “Janet would you PLEASE look over there”)</b></i>, I walked over to the tree and was trying to read the words on the seat <i><b>(There were only two words - “Marry Me?”)</b></i>, when I saw him kneeling down with a handmade ring box and a beautiful ring! There have been many special days of my life with Stephen, but this beat all! I excitedly said YES! And got a few wonderful moments on my beautiful swing! </p>
										<br />
										<p>That swing now hangs as a decoration on the wall of my living room, and I am once again tree swingless. <i><b>Ok I get the hint...</b></i> </p>
